# Digital DIY - Materials to support computational thinking workshops

## About

**Digital DIY** is a project of the [Digital Literacy Centre](https://github.com/dlclled) at the Faculty of Education at the University of British Columbia aimed at developing computational thinking through game-based pedagogy using [littleBits](https://littlebits.cc/), an open hardware platform for maker spaces.

Although our primary aim with this work is directed toward Middle Years education and the development of curriculum to enhance the unique identity of Middle Years teacher education within the context of the LLED’s recent integration within the Elementary and Middle Years program option of the Faculty of Education, we seek to develop courses and workshop protocols that are pertinent to a variety of ages and populations.
